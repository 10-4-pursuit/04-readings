# Introduction to Node.js and Express

## Overview
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for building scalable network applications. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.

## Brief History
- **Node.js**: Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl and was first released in 2009. It was inspired by the desire to have a server-side JavaScript runtime that could handle I/O operations asynchronously and efficiently. Node.js gained popularity quickly due to its performance and scalability, especially for building real-time web applications.
- **Express.js**: Express.js was initially released in 2010 by TJ Holowaychuk. It was created as a minimalist web framework for Node.js to simplify the process of building web applications and APIs. Express.js quickly became one of the most popular Node.js frameworks due to its simplicity, flexibility, and robust feature set.

## What You Will Learn
- Basics of Node.js for server-side programming
- Setting up an Express server to handle web requests
- Handling routing, middleware, and HTTP requests/responses
- Using templates to render dynamic content
- Working with databases and external APIs
- Deploying Node.js and Express applications

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Familiarity with web development concepts (HTML, CSS)
- Knowledge of asynchronous programming concepts (callbacks, promises)

## Why Node.js and Express?
- Node.js allows for building fast, scalable network applications.
- Express.js provides a minimalist framework for building web applications.
- JavaScript can be used for both client-side and server-side development, enabling full-stack development with a single language.
- Large ecosystem with a wide range of modules and libraries available through npm (Node Package Manager).

## Getting Started
To get started with Node.js and Express, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.

2. **Create a New Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for your Node.js project.

    ```bash
    mkdir my-express-app
    ```

3. **Initialize Node.js Project**: Navigate to your project directory and run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project. This will create a `package.json` file.

    ```bash
    cd my-express-app
    npm init -y
    ```

4. **Install Express.js**: Next, install Express.js as a dependency for your project using npm.

    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```

5. **Create an Express Server File**: Create a new file named `app.js` (or any other preferred name) in your project directory. This file will contain the code for your Express server.

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello World!');
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });
    ```

6. **Run Your Express Server**: Finally, run your Express server by executing the following command in your terminal.

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

    Your server should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`. Open a web browser and navigate to this URL to see your "Hello World!" message.
