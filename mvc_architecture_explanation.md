# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is a design pattern widely used in software development for organizing code in a manner that separates concerns, making applications more modular, maintainable, and scalable. This architectural pattern divides the application into three interconnected components, allowing developers to work on individual aspects of the application without affecting the others.

## Model
The Model component represents the application's data structure, directly managing the data, logic, and rules of the application. 

- **Organization:** Models are organized around the data they represent. Each model typically corresponds to a table in the database, with the fields in the model representing the columns in the table.

## View
The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. It specifies how user inputs are relayed back to the controller and presents data to the user.

- **Organization:** Views are organized by the user interface elements they represent, such as forms, buttons, and displays of data.

## Controller
The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user input, manipulates data using the Models, and selects Views for response.

- **Organization:** Controllers are organized according to the functionalities they manage related to a single entity or a group of related entities.

## How MVC Organizes Applications

- **Separation of Concerns:** By separating the application into Models, Views, and Controllers, MVC allows for managing complexity and supports a more organized and scalable codebase.

- **Modularity:** Components in an MVC application are loosely coupled, facilitating easier updates, testing, and maintenance.

- **Improved Collaboration:** Different developers can work on the Models, Views, and Controllers concurrently without causing conflicts in the codebase.
